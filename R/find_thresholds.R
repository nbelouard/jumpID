#'Find thresholds of diffusive spread 
#'
#'Find thresholds of diffusive spread and get a list of potential jumps. 
#'This function identifies spatial discontinuities in the distribution of 
#'speciesâ€™ occurrences between the putative limit of the continuous, diffusive 
#'spread (i.e., the invasion front) and outlying occurrences.
#'This function must be applied after attribute_sectors() and before find_jumps().

#'@param dataset A dataset to be processed, output of attribute_sectors()
#'@param gap_size Distance between the invasion front and a positive point
#'necessary for it to be considered a jump, in kilometers (default: 15)
#'@param negatives Should the function verify that negative surveys were found 
#'in the spatial discontinuities? (default: TRUE)

#'@return Two tables: one table \code{Thresholds} containing the threshold per year and sector,
