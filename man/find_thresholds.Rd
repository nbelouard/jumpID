\title{Find thresholds of diffusive spread}
\usage{
find_thresholds(dataset, gap_size = 15, negatives = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{A dataset to be processed, output of attribute_sectors()}

\item{gap_size}{Distance between the invasion front and a positive point
necessary for it to be considered a jump, in kilometers (default: 15)}

\item{negatives}{Should the function verify that negative surveys were found 
in the spatial discontinuities? (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
Two tables: one table \code{Thresholds} containing the threshold per year and sector,
one table \code{potJumps} containing the list of potential jumps for find_jumps()
}
\description{
Find thresholds of diffusive spread and get a list of potential jumps. 
This function identifies spatial discontinuities in the distribution of 
speciesâ€™ occurrences between the putative limit of the continuous, diffusive 
spread (i.e., the invasion front) and outlying occurrences.
This function must be applied after attribute_sectors() and before find_jumps().

thresholds <- find_thresholds(dataset)
